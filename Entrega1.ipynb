    "The main problem to solve consists of the generation of new hand-drawn sketch drawings from training examples of <i>Quick, Draw!</i>, a sketching game. The solution will be implemented using an encoder-decoder autoregressive model.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- <b>Input:</b> The input of the model is a dataset of hand-drawn sketches, each represented as a sequence of motor actions controlling a pen: the direction of the movement, when to lift the pen up, and when to stop drawing. More concretely, each input is a vector containing 5 elements: <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(\\Delta&space;x,&space;\\Delta&space;y,&space;p_1,&space;p_2,&space;p_3)\" title=\"(\\Delta x, \\Delta y, p_1, p_2, p_3)\" /> \n",

    "  \n",
    "- <b>Output:</b> At each test, our autoregressive model outputs the 5 element vector’s probability distribution, and then we get samples of that distribution. Hence, out complete model should output a vector of the same structure than the given one at the input.  \n",

    "  \n",
    "A metric that could be used to measure the network's performance is its loss value. However, these values could widely vary depending on the dataset that is being used and the parameters of the network. It also depends on the training (and the number of training samples used). Hence, we cannot specify an expected value of loss, since it would be more of a wild guess rather than an expected value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We propose another metric that could be used to measure the performance of the system. Since what we want is to generate similar sketches to those made by humans, we make a grading system in which each sketch (either real or generated by the algorithm) is graded as real, possibly real or fake. From this grading system we expect the real sketches to be mainly classified as real, whilst most of the ones generated by the algorithm should be classified as either real or possibly real. The expected result is that at least more than half of the sketches generated by the algorithm are classified as real or possibly real, on average.\n",
